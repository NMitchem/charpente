# CLAUDE.md — charpente

Instructions for agents working in this repo. Read the docs in this order before writing
any code: README.md → DESIGN.md → PLAN.md (MANIFESTO.md for spirit; DECISIONS.md before
proposing to change an approach; NEIGHBORS.md before designing any subsystem with prior
art — DST, storage, replication).

## What this is

An agent-native, single-binary Rust backend platform. Design phase → M0. The milestones
and exit criteria in PLAN.md are the roadmap; do not reorder M0's dependency sequence —
the sim-capable IO layer comes first because it cannot be retrofitted.

## Hard rules (the guarantees are the product)

1. **No ambient nondeterminism inside the core.** Zero direct calls to wall clocks, OS
   randomness, raw filesystem/network APIs, or thread/task spawning from core code — all IO
   goes through the `Clock`/`Entropy`/`Disk`/`Net` traits (DESIGN §1). Enforce mechanically
   (clippy `disallowed_methods`/`disallowed_types` deny-list in CI from the first commit),
   not by review.
2. **No escape hatches on guarantees.** No "fast mode" bypassing the log, no network awaits
   inside transactions, no optional determinism, no feature flags on correctness
   (MANIFESTO §8). If a feature seems to need one, the design is wrong — stop and redesign.
3. **Sim-first development.** Every core subsystem lands with seeded fault-injection tests
   in the same PR. A bug found in sim gets its seed recorded in the regression suite. If
   you fix a bug without a failing seed first, you haven't reproduced it — find the seed.
4. **Assertions in the TigerBeetle style.** Assert invariants and *negative space* (what
   must never happen) liberally in core code; assertions stay on in release builds until a
   measured reason says otherwise.
5. **Error messages are product surface** (DESIGN §7). A contract violation must name the
   contract, the site, and the fix; a sim failure must print the seed and a one-command
   repro. Write tests against error output.
6. **Public-API changes update the docs in the same commit.** The docs are the spec;
   drifted docs are bugs.

## Style

- Plain direct Rust; smallest code that does the job. No helper-function sprawl, no
  speculative abstraction — the only sanctioned abstraction boundaries are the ones in
  DESIGN.md (IO traits, log, table layer).
- Comments only for constraints the code can't express (a rationale comment is fine; a
  narration comment is noise).
- Let errors bubble unless there's a specific behavior for that error; in core code,
  prefer asserting an invariant over handling an "impossible" state.
- Dependencies: minimal and justified in the PR description; nothing inside the
  deterministic boundary that does its own IO, threading, or time. `redb` (behind `Disk`),
  `hyper`-family at the HTTP edge, proc-macro crates for the derive surface are expected.
  Study `madsim`/`turmoil` (NEIGHBORS.md) before writing the simulator rather than after.

## Workflow

- This is a personal project of Noah's; commit directly to `main` until told otherwise.
  No Co-Authored-By trailers on commits.
- Verification before completion: for any core change, the evidence bar is "sim suite
  green over N fresh seeds," not "unit tests pass." State the seed count in the PR/commit.
- When a decision contradicts DECISIONS.md, don't silently override it — reopen the entry
  with the new evidence and get Noah's sign-off.

## Current state / immediate next steps

- Founding + knowledge docs committed. License: MIT OR Apache-2.0 (DECISIONS §9). All
  five crate names reserved on crates.io (DECISIONS §8). Workspace scaffolded with the
  nondeterminism deny-list in `clippy.toml` enforced in CI; new nondeterminism sources
  (tokio, rand, …) get deny-list entries in the same commit that adds the dependency.
- **M0 step 1 done**: sync poll-shaped IO traits in `charpente-core::io` (DECISIONS §10),
  full simulator in `charpente-sim` (seeded xoshiro256++, virtual time, fault matrix:
  injected write/sync errors, crash between any two disk ops, subset-of-sectors torn
  writes, partitions), production impls in `charpente::prod` (the one deny-list-allowed
  module). Crash-recovery property tests prove the harness catches what it must: naive
  length-prefix recovery fails under torn writes (regression seed 0x8bee1752811ae873
  pinned in tests/crash_recovery.rs), checked recovery holds over fresh seeds every run.
  `CHARPENTE_SEED=0x… cargo test -p charpente-sim --test <file>` replays any universe.
- **M0 step 2 done**: segmented checksummed WAL (`charpente-core::log`, format in DESIGN
  §2) + `StateMachine`/`Engine` apply loop (`charpente-core::engine`). Recovery truncates
  at the cut and syncs it before appends (stale-frame-resurrection guard, property-tested
  with fixed-size payloads); IO failure poisons the log (fsyncgate). Sim found one
  workload-model bug — recovery itself can hit injected fsync faults and must be
  restart-retried (seed 0x5cafb3ac016dccf9, noted in tests/wal.rs).
- **M0 step 3 done**: typed tables on redb behind `Disk` (`charpente-core::table`:
  `Id<T>`, `Row`, `Store`/`Snapshot`/`Writer`, exact-match secondary indexes) + the
  `#[table]` macro in charpente-macros. Durability model in DESIGN §4: apply at
  Durability::None + applied_seq meta key, checkpoint persists, WAL replays the gap.
  redb's raw-path constructors are deny-listed (Store::open is the only mount).
  Sim-established: redb's layout is deterministic; `Database::drop` is a graceful
  close, so crash tests must crash with the db open. `File` gained a `Send + Sync`
  supertrait; the sim world is now `Arc<Mutex>` (honest, uncontended).
- **M0 step 4 done**: typed transactions (`charpente-core::db`). `Db::transact(fn(&mut
  Tx) -> Result<T, E>)`: reads via the `View` trait (snapshot + read-your-own-writes
  overlay), writes/enqueues/emits buffered and committed as ONE effects record (payload
  format in DESIGN §2), applied to the store post-sync through the `Schema` registry;
  `TxError::{App, Io}` separates app rejection from platform failure. Enqueues
  materialize in the built-in `charpente.jobs` table (step 6's substrate); emits stay
  log-only. `StateMachine::apply` is fallible; a post-sync apply failure poisons the
  engine (restart-and-recover). Property-tested under the fault matrix including the
  dual-write invariant (jobs ≡ committed txns, exactly), plus a meta-test proving the
  harness catches apply-before-sync ordering.
- **M0 step 5 done**: HTTP layer. Deterministic kernel in `charpente::http` (typed
  `Request`/`Response`, router with mount-time conflict panic, `#[route]` argument
  convention enforced by the macro, 1 MiB body cap fencing the record-size assert,
  sessions inside the commit point via the platform `Session` table — raw tokens, M1
  hashes); one transaction per request, 200 only after the WAL sync (ack-after-durable).
  hyper/tokio confined to `charpente::serve` (wire↔struct + channel into the kernel
  thread); tokio's ambient APIs deny-listed. Sim suite includes the request-level crash
  property (a 200 survives kill-at-any-point; jobs ≡ acked requests) and a determinism
  check; loopback smoke test drives real HTTP/1.1 bytes. `#[route]` emits
  `::charpente` paths, so it works in dependent crates (and integration tests), not in
  charpente's own src. `Disk` and `Entropy` gained a `Send` supertrait (the kernel
  thread owns the App), mirroring `File`'s earlier `Send + Sync`.
- **Pre-step-6 harness upgrade done** (from the 2026-07-02 DST research pass): swarm-
  sampled `FaultConfig` per universe (`run_universes_swarm!`; sampling order is frozen
  replay contract) + sometimes-coverage (`Sim::cover`, auto-covered `fault:*`/`crash:*`/
  `restart`, batch-level `require:` keys that fail by name when never hit). The swarm
  runner catches in-universe panics and reports seed+config+repro — the old
  panic-bypasses-seed-printing gap is closed for migrated tests (it remains on the
  frozen legacy runner). All four fault-matrix property tests migrated; `run_universes!`
  and every pinned seed are frozen forever. DESIGN now records the executor same-shape
  rule (the "which ready source next" decision is identical code in prod and sim),
  tracked fault-matrix extensions (bit-level durable corruption, misdirected writes,
  latent read errors), and two log durability fences (recovery-horizon rule for mid-log
  corruption; directory-entry durability at rotation) — all land with WAL segment
  management. NEIGHBORS carries the 2026-07 quarterly intel (quadrant still empty).
- Next: M0 step 6 per PLAN.md — queue + cron: post-commit lease/dispatch off the
  `charpente.jobs` table, idempotency keys, typed retry policy, cron ticks as
  transactions; this is where the deterministic edge executor (DECISIONS §10) lands —
  the kernel loop gains its second and third event sources. Its spec must carry the
  executor same-shape rule (DESIGN §1).
